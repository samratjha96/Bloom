In 1984, educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom discovered that students receiving **one-on-one tutoring** scored **2 standard deviations (+2σ)** above the classroom average — jumping to the **top 2%**. Bloom called this the "2 Sigma Problem": the effect is proven, but personal tutors don't scale.

**Bloom solves this with AI.** It generates a structured syllabus, delivers lessons one at a time, reads your annotations and feedback, then tailors the next lesson to your exact understanding level — just like a real tutor would.

## Two Ways to Use

| Mode | Setup | Best for |
|------|-------|----------|
| **CLI** | Claude Code + terminal | Power users who like Markdown editors |
| **Web** | Browser (React + FastAPI) | Visual learners, shareable setup |

Both follow the same flow: **syllabus → lesson → annotate → feedback → next lesson → evaluation → summary**.

---

## Quick Start: CLI Mode

Requires only [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code). No backend.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Li-Evan/Bloom.git
cd Bloom

# Install the tutor skill locally for this clone
mkdir -p .claude/skills
cp -R skills/bloom-tutor .claude/skills/

claude
```

Then say: `Create a new folder and help me learn [any topic]`

See [GUIDE.md](./GUIDE.md) for the full walkthrough.

## Quick Start: Web Mode

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- Node.js 18+
- An OpenAI-compatible LLM API key (e.g. [DashScope](https://dashscope.console.aliyun.com/), OpenAI, etc.)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Li-Evan/Bloom.git
cd Bloom

# Configure
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — fill in LLM_API_KEY

# Backend
cd backend && uv sync && uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Frontend (new terminal)
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173. Click **New Course**, choose **Topic** or **Source Upload**, and start learning.

### Docker

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # fill in API key
docker compose up -d   # visit http://localhost:3000
```

## How It Works

### Topic Mode

```
Create course → AI generates syllabus + lesson 01
                        ↓
        Read lesson → highlight text → add annotations
                        ↓
        Write feedback → answer thought questions
                        ↓
        Click "Done Reading" → AI generates next lesson
        (answer review + annotation responses + new content)
                        ↓
        Repeat until all mastery items checked ✅
                        ↓
        Auto-generate evaluation → then summary
```

### Source Mode

```
Upload PDF / TXT / MD → AI generates syllabus + source-reading chapter
                          ↓
       Read source → highlight text → ask and get an immediate answer
                          ↓
       Click "Done Reading" → AI reads the full source + Q&A, then generates the next lesson
                          ↓
       Continue with the normal adaptive lesson flow
```

## Features

- **Two course modes** — generate from a topic, or upload a PDF/TXT/MD source
- **Reference material** — paste textbook chapters, papers, or notes when creating a topic course
- **Highlight Q&A sessions** — select any text in any lesson (or source) and a small icon pops up; click it to ask. The highlighted text stays marked in yellow, the AI answers instantly, and you can keep asking follow-ups in the same thread. The window is draggable and collapses into a margin dot you can reopen anytime. Each session sees the full lesson + the highlighted span + its own conversation, and your questions still feed the next lesson.
- **Adaptive lessons** — each lesson addresses your specific gaps from the previous one
- **Chapter sidebar** — quick-jump between lessons while reading
- **Collapsible syllabus** — track mastery progress without clutter
- **Streaming generation** — watch AI write the next lesson in real-time

## Skills

Bloom ships a set of portable **[Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) skills** in [`skills/`](./skills/) — self-contained capability packs you can copy into `~/.claude/skills/` (global) or any project's `.claude/skills/` and use anywhere.

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| **bloom-tutor** | The full interactive tutoring system as one skill — syllabus → adaptive lessons → `???` annotations → evaluation → summary. CLI mode, packaged and portable. |
| **learn-deep** | Default deep-dive entry — runs all five lenses below in one pass, then helps you pick a direction |
| **learn-crossover** | Learn a new concept by leveraging what you already know (structural analogies) |
| **learn-occam** | Decide whether / how deeply something is worth learning (ROI, just-enough) |
| **learn-graph** | Build a knowledge-graph map of a field plus a learning path |
| **learn-prototype** | Learn by building the crappiest working prototype, then iterating |
| **learn-feynman** | Verify true understanding by explaining it back |

Each folder is dependency-free: copy it into a skills directory, then just talk to Claude Code (e.g. *"help me learn X"*, *"I'm done reading"*).

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Backend | Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, SQLite |
| Frontend | React, Vite, Tailwind CSS |
| AI | Any OpenAI-compatible LLM API |
| Container | Docker, docker-compose |
| Font | Outfit, JetBrains Mono |

## Commands

```bash
make dev-backend      # backend with hot reload
make dev-frontend     # frontend dev server
make test             # run pytest
make up / make down   # docker start / stop
```

## The Science

| Concept | What it means |
|---------|--------------|
| **Bloom's 2 Sigma** | 1-on-1 tutoring = +2σ performance over classroom |
